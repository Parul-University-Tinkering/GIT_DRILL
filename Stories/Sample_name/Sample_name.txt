Hey folkss!!!
How's it going,doing well.. Me too
Here is a brief of my begining of my coding journey ..
The first and universal code is hello world btw..
so i was too exited to write it but as soon as i got into first line i got blank.
It literally take 2 days to print "Hello world" ...finally get it
i know it is simple but that situation is mind ... haha
